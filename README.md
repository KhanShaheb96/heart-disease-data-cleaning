# Heart Disease Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (R Project)

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

This project focuses on **data cleaning, preprocessing, and preparation** for a **Heart Disease Prediction dataset** using **R programming**.

The dataset was modified from the original UCI Heart Disease dataset to explore real-world data challenges like missing values, outliers, invalid values, imbalanced classes, and the need for normalization.

---

## ðŸ›  Techniques Applied

- **Handling Missing Values**  
  âž” Replaced missing numerical values with mean and discrete values with mode.

- **Outlier Detection and Removal**  
  âž” Used **Boxplots** and **IQR method** to detect and clean outliers in the `cholesterol (chol)` column.

- **Data Type Conversion**  
  âž” Converted categorical text values into **numeric labels** (e.g., `restecg`, `num`).

- **Normalization**  
  âž” Applied **Min-Max Scaling** to `trestbps` (Resting Blood Pressure) for feature standardization.

- **Duplicate Removal**  
  âž” Removed duplicate records and duplicate IDs.

- **Invalid Data Correction**  
  âž” Replaced invalid values (`<= 0`) in `trestbps` and `thalch` with the mean of valid entries.

- **Data Filtering**  
  âž” Selected patients with **cholesterol > 200** for targeted analysis.

- **Handling Imbalanced Dataset**  
  âž” Manually oversampled the minority class (`Has Disease`) using `dplyr` to achieve balanced classes.

- **Train/Test Split**  
  âž” Randomly split data into **70% training** and **30% testing** sets.

- **Descriptive Statistics**  
  âž” Calculated **mean, median, mode** for selected attributes.

- **Spread Measures**  
  âž” Measured **range, IQR, variance, and standard deviation** to understand data variability.
